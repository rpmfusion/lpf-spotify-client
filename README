lpf-spotify-client README
=========================

This is a lpf package. It's only use is to install another package,
called the target package. For lpf-spotify-client, the target package is
spotify-client.

The package can be used in two ways:

In the GUI, you could find the lpf-spotify-client icon. By clicking on it
you will download spotify-client, build and install an rpm.

On the command line, you can use the lpf command, see lpf -h for usage. The
basic usage is
```
    $ lpf update
```
which does the same thing as clicking on the GUI icon.
